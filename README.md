# 15_Puzzle_Problem
This project serves to solve the 15 puzzle problem using AI as discussed in the textbook Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach.

# Overview
This is project is part of the AI course work that I have taken and is still in development, as such there will be many
changes to the code and README during the duration of the course.

## Phase 1
The first phase of this project aim to setup the 15 puzzle problem that displays a grid of numbers with a blank space. 
The grid must then be randomly shuffled using only valid moves and display the shuffled board. The AI logic must be able to solve the puzzle and display the solved puzzle.
