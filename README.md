# 15_Puzzle_Problem
This project serves to solve the 15 puzzle problem using AI as discussed in the textbook Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach.

# Overview
This is project is part of the AI course work that I have taken and is still in development, as such there will be many
changes to the code and README during the duration of the course.

## Phase 1
The first phase of this project aim to setup the 15 puzzle problem that displays a grid of numbers with a blank space. 
The grid must be populated by a random order of numbers. The gap must also be placed in a random location. The 
program must be able to create, randomize and more numberes tiles.
##### Optional
Implement functionality and described above and create a driver program that takes in input from the user to move the gap around.
